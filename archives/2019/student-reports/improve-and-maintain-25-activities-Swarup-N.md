***Google Summer of Code, 2019***

**Project Details**<br>
The goal of my project was to Improve and Maintain 25 Sugar Activities. I chose to work with 25 activities that were entirely Python based. Each activity had one or more issues I worked upon. The issues were bug fixes, design related issues and implementating new features.

I have included links to commits to all the activities and issues I worked upon.
